  abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning underpin a collection of algorithms with an impressive ability to decipher the content of images. These deep learning algorithms are being applied to biological images and are transforming the analysis and interpretation of imaging data. These advances are positioned to render difficult analyses routine and to enable researchers to carry out new, previously impossible experiments. Here we review the intersection between deep learning and cellular image analysis and provide an overview of both the mathematical mechanics and the programming frameworks of deep learning that are pertinent to life scientists. We survey the field's progress in four key applications: image classification, image segmentation, object tracking, and augmented microscopy. Last, we relay our labs' experience with three key aspects of implementing deep learning in the laboratory: annotating training data, selecting and training a range of neural network architectures, and deploying solutions. We also highlight existing datasets and implementations for each surveyed application.},

  abstract = {Pretrained neural network models for biological segmentation can provide good out-of-the-box results for many image types. However, such models do not allow users to adapt the segmentation style to their specific needs and can perform suboptimally for test images that are very different from the training images. Here we introduce Cellpose 2.0, a new package that includes an ensemble of diverse pretrained models as well as a human-in-the-loop pipeline for rapid prototyping of new custom models. We show that models pretrained on the Cellpose dataset can be fine-tuned with only 500--1,000 user-annotated regions of interest (ROI) to perform nearly as well as models trained on entire datasets with up to 200,000 ROI. A human-in-the-loop approach further reduced the required user annotation to 100--200 ROI, while maintaining high-quality segmentations. We provide software tools such as an annotation graphical user interface, a model zoo and a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate the adoption of Cellpose 2.0.},

  abstract = {Morphological profiling is a valuable tool in phenotypic drug discovery. The advent of high-throughput automated imaging has enabled the capturing of a wide range of morphological features of cells or organisms in response to perturbations at the single-cell resolution. Concurrently, significant advances in machine learning and deep learning, especially in computer vision, have led to substantial improvements in analyzing large-scale high-content images at high throughput. These efforts have facilitated understanding of compound mechanism of action, drug repurposing, characterization of cell morphodynamics under perturbation, and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the field of morphological profiling. We summarize the image profiling analysis workflow, survey a broad spectrum of analysis strategies encompassing feature engineering-- and deep learning--based approaches, and introduce publicly available benchmark datasets. We place a particular emphasis on the application of deep learning in this pipeline, covering cell segmentation, image representation learning, and multimodal learning. Additionally, we illuminate the application of morphological profiling in phenotypic drug discovery and highlight potential challenges and opportunities in this field.},
