\begin{abstract}
Quantifying the contents of objects in images is a common challenge in biological imaging. The most widely used software to do so require significant manual intervention. Here we introduce our library cp\_measure, which provides programmatic access to the most widespread metrics to convert images and objects into features. We then demonstrate that the features are consistent to the standard ones and showcase tasks for which our tool is more suitable than the alternatives. Our tool opens the door to community-driven  development and expansion of bioimage analysis metrics and pipelines, increasing both the accessibility and reproducibility of the field.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org6430daa}
The field of biological imaging leverages data from cell microscopy images to obtain biological insights. Microscopy techniques allows us to acquire information from a multitude of sources, such as illumination, fluorescent dyes or even proteins tagged with other proteins that fluoresce, acting as a beacon and providing information on quantity and/or localization.

The main task at the core bioimage analysis is identifying features that convey information of the state of a cell or its contents. This entails combining identified objects with pixel data to quantify their morphology and other information sources, such as intensity distributions.

Morphological profiling a subfield of bioimaging that focuses on the cells and the shapes and properties of their organelles. It is usually supported by both statistical methods and machine and deep learning approaches. One of its biggest applications is drug discovery, where it is used primarily due to its low acquisition cost and capabilities for scaling to screen many compounds efficiently \citep{sealDecadeSystematicReview2024}. It can also function as a complement to other high throughput techniques, such as genomics.
\subsection{The current state of bioimage analysis}
\label{sec:org8f5b33d}
The most widely-used software to process biological imaging data is CellProfiler \citep{stirlingCellProfiler4Improvements2021}. Its target users are biologists with limited programmatic expertise. The accessibility that manually implemented workflows reduces its suitability for automated analyses and the composition of more complex pipelines. In this context we define accessibility as the lack of friction to use the software in computational pipelines.

The usage of CellProfiler entails a higher degree of friction for composite pipelines that orchestrate multiple tools. Its focus on manually-defined workflows adjusted for specific use-cases makes it less suitable for many high throughput analyses. Additionally, CellProfiler has a significant number of dependencies. It depends on libraries from both the Python and Java languages, thus increasing the number of things that may go wrong when setting up or integrating with other tools. Tough containers partially alleviate this problem, they carry additional complexity and caveats.

A small subset of the features in CellProfiler is provided by scikit-image, but this is greatly limited and cannot be reliably compared to the existing body of work that used CellProfiler to obtain the measurements. The other big problem of CellProfiler is its dependency on human interaction at many steps of the analysis, opening the door to human mistakes and hindering analyses reproducibility.

A CellProfiler pipeline is does not integrate well with other tools. Its existing plug-in system is inaccessible for most users and has strong limitations. Building automated pipelines that contain CellProfiler and integrating tools within its components are time and effort-consuming challenges.

In this space there is a vacuum for a software library that covers the generalist and high throughput use-cases for which CellProfiler is inadequate. Distributed CellProfiler would cover this case if not for its cloud-only approach and dependency on preconfigured pipelines, as well as its limited debugging capabilities \citep{mcquinCellProfiler30Nextgeneration2018}.

Other recent software has been published aiming to fill this unoccupied niche, but their solutions are unsuitable for practical usage at scale: First, their features have completely independent implementations from the original ones, thus are not guaranteed to reproduce existing results and the biological interpretations may be different from the current field standard. Additionally, their implementations are not modular nor scale well upon increases to the data size. Some of them, akin to Distributed CellProfiler, are based on main use-case is cloud services.
\subsection{Engineered features in the era of deep learning}
\label{sec:org9dc3dfa}
The unprecedented evolution of deep learning methods in recent years has made available many different ways to process imaging data. Nevertheless, these are limited in their capacity to provide biological interpretation \citep{moenDeepLearningCellular2019}.

Unlike with deep learning-based features, whose interpretation requires complex methods such as counterfactuals or attention maps, most of the engineered features have a mathematical definition that is vastly simpler to translate into biological insights.

Engineered features can also outperform deep learning ones under some conditions \citep{tangMorphologicalProfilingDrug2024}. Though deep learning features are more likely to improve in the coming years

It also has a higher barrier of entry, since most models require annotating data for training and testing. Even new foundational models do not generalize well for out-of-distribution data.

The main target users of such a tool would be biologists in need of automation and reproducibility, as well as computer and data scientists that want to dive into the field of biological imaging.

As a whole, there is still a role to be played for engineered features. The community is missing a generalist tool that converts images and masks into vectors in an automated fashion and portable across fields. It serves as complementary approach deep learning methods.
\section{Extraction of interpretable features using cp\_measure}
\label{sec:org5633614}
With cp\_measure we recapitulated all features used in the vast majority of experiments: One object and one imaging channel (e.g., intensity), one object and multiple channels (e.g., Manders correlation) and multiple objects (e.g., number of neighbors). 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includesvg[width=.9\linewidth]{./figs/cpmeasure_overview}
\caption{\label{fig:orgea7e72a}Extraction of measurements based on a collective of objects. cp\_measure generates features from images by using the local information in a mask-defined region of interest. Its produces measurements for every object, and is usually used to acquire information on the pairwise combination of all the available channels.}
\end{figure}

The cp\_measure's code base was based on CellProfiler's, but we removed the sections of the code that are unnecessary for programmatic usage, thus separating the actual functional components from the orchestration logic. It improves reusability, testability and its makes it possible for more people to access and improve its internals in the future. It aims to be a stepping stone to increased extensibility and maintainability.

Our library aims to remain consistent with the current scientific python ecosystem. The main interface matches that of the widely-used scikit-image \citep{waltScikitimageImageProcessing2014}. This greatly reduces the effort needed to integrate it in existing workflows and tools.

By isolating and cleaning the implemented mathematics of CellProfiler we aim to make the measurement methods more accessible to computer and data scientists, while still leveraging the decade and a half of existing features that are present in numerous datasets, maintaining a higher degree of compatibility. To retain this compatibility in the long term requires contributing this changes back into CellProfiler, be it directly or as a dependency.

When comparing the equivalent pipelines, cp\_measure's minimal overhead results in faster processing times than CellProfiler (TODO add benchmark).

We demonstrate the correlation of cp\_measure compared to a comparable CellProfiler pipeline using a representative subset of the JUMP dataset \citep{chandrasekaranJUMPCellPainting2023}. Then we demonstrate cases in which cp\_measure can help identify biological phenotypes: first using 3D images of astrocytes and then using spatial transcriptomics dataset. These use-cases demonstrate its widespread applicability. 
\subsection{Our features match analogous CellProfiler measurements}
\label{sec:org37e389d}

Our first aim was to validate the features from cp\_measure compared to the CellProfiler standard ones. We used images from the JUMP dataset, containing more than 130,000 chemical and genetic perturbations. We first curated a set of genetic perturbations that, based on existing analyses, contained cells with distinctive morphologies to all others based on the CellProfiler features. Using this curated dataset, we segmented the cytosol and nuclei of the cells using a CellProfiler pipeline to obtain both segmentation masks and the original morphological features.

Next, we used the segmentation masks to calculate the cp\_measure features. Then we mapped the features from CellProfiler to cp\_measure and compared the values in both. Figure \ref{fig:org7fe862f} shows this comparison. Then we demonstrate that we recapitulate the CellProfiler features.

\subsection{Results and examples of usage}
\label{sec:org8ef524e}
\subsubsection{Classification of astrocytes and their distinctive features}
\label{sec:org3d97e6f}

As a demonstration of its ease of use, we used cp\_measure for featurization in a cell classification workflow. We used it to process 433 3D images of astrocytes containing 831 cells \citep{kalinin3DCellNuclear2018}. We then calculated the median value for every feature in a cell and the number of cells, following standard procedures \citep{caicedoDataanalysisStrategiesImagebased2017}. Then we trained a Gradient Boosting classifier to identify which day. With this we identified which features distinguish cells on the later samples and distinguish subpopulations. It is worth noting that there will be some redundancy in the information contained in the cp\_measure features, and thus during cases in which multiple features inform on similar data subsets.

Our results showcased the axis length of the cell to be a major indicator of phenotypic effect, implying that cells became more elongated on their minor axis.}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:orgf37b369}
The usage of image analysis pipelines that require manual setups hinders reproducibility and hinders our ability to compare different datasets. In this work we introduced our new library cp\_measure, which provides widely used engineered features and enables simpler automated analyses of microscopy data in either short scripts and complex pipelines. This also removes the requirement of using graphical interfaces to process microscopy data, resulting in better scaling capabilities for high-content microscopy data without the need of cloud-based infrastructure.

The biologically interpretable features provided by cp\_measure complement deep learning ones and offer a better mechanistic understanding of the underlying biology. When used in tandem with generalist tools it enables more insightful pipelines that leverage machine and deep learning approaches. 

These measurements have already been used in non-biological contexts, such as environmental monitoring \citep{ideharaExploringNileRed2025}, thus these engineered metrics also benefit other scientific fields beyond morphological profiling. In general, we see the decomposition of CellProfiler into modular components as a way to facili
\section{Future work}
\label{sec:org5cdbb12}
There are multiple paths to improve and expand the functionality of cp\_measure. The first and most obvious is to integrate its measurements back to CellProfiler library. This would ensure that the results from pipelines built with either tool will be comparable in the future, while also providing the opportunity of formalizing the programmatic interface --- inputs and outputs --- of measurements.

Developing a comprehensive tests suite would guarantee mathematical correctness under the possible edge cases that may be encountered when dealing with new data. This test suite in turn would in turn open the door to further speed-ups in multiple ways: Firstly, optimizing the measurements that consume the most time, starting with object granularity (\textasciitilde{}80\% of the time). Additionally, it is possible to implement measurements using numba for just-in-time compiling and/or adding GPU support \citep{lamNumbaLLVMbasedPython2015}.

There is further space for improvement. First, provide a wrapper for all features that masp to scikit-image's regionprops as close as possible. Secondly, a list of essential measurements for use-cases where speed is more important than using all the features. By lowering the barrier of effort required to integrate cp\_measure into existing pipelines these 

Long-term, we envision cp\_measure can be the place to develop and distribute new measurements. While CellProfiler's measurements are widely used in bioimaging studies, the existing palette of measurements could be further extended to cover novel use-cases brought upon by novel developments in imaging acquisition devices and methods. Working with the community to further the number of measurements to better match the current questions scientists pose to imaging data.
